                    Kellen was awarded Summa Cum Laude as one of the top performers of his computer science class. Kellen was lucky enough to have been
                    a student of professor <a href="https://archive.gunnisontimes.com/obituaries/john-peterson" class="link">John Peterson</a> before his untimely death in 2017.

            <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>
                Kellen has been working professionally for 8 years as a software engineer.
                Beginning with an internship at Lockheed Martin, Kellen gained experience in multiple industries and programming languages. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Kellen began his career at Lockheed Martin where he worked on a missile defense project. He worked closely with the IT team
                and gained a deep knowledge of system administration while also coding an application to track internal hires / departs.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2018, Kellen moved to Tyler Technologies. He would switch focus from defense to local
                government.
                Kellen was responsible for writing custom payment processing software (similar to Stripe)
                for processing users utility bills. This allowed Tyler Technologies to save cost on payment processor fees which greatly increased revenue for the company
                and thus increased revenue for shareholders.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2022, Kellen moved to Tasso Inc. He would switch focus to biomedical technologies.
                <a href="https://www.tassoinc.com/" class="link">Tasso</a> is a startup company that makes devices to draw blood via suction (in a painless manner).
                This revolutionary technology will allow people to get blood tests from the comfort of their home.
                Kellen writes the APIs for customers to place orders for said devices. 
                Roughly 80% of order traffic goes through Kellens software.

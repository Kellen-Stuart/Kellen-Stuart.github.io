            <p>
              Kellen has been working professionally for 8 years as a software
              engineer. Beginning with an internship at Lockheed Martin, Kellen
              gained experience in multiple industries and programming
              languages.

              Kellen began his career at Lockheed Martin where he worked on a
              missile defense project. He worked closely with the IT team and
              gained a deep knowledge of system administration while also coding
              an application to track internal hires / departs.

              In 2018, Kellen moved to Tyler Technologies. He would switch focus
              from defense to local government. Kellen was responsible for
              writing custom payment processing software (similar to Stripe) for
              processing users utility bills. This allowed Tyler Technologies to
              save cost on payment processor fees which greatly increased
              revenue for the company and thus increased revenue for
              shareholders.
